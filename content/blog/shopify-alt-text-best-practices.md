## Why Alt Text Matters

Alt text (alternative text) is a crucial element of web accessibility. It describes images to users who can't see them, including those using screen readers. For Shopify store owners, proper alt text is essential for both ADA compliance and SEO.

## What Makes Good Alt Text?

**Be Descriptive**: Describe what's in the image, not just that it's an image.

**Be Specific**: Include relevant details like color, style, and key features.

**Be Concise**: Keep it under 125 characters when possible.

**Avoid Redundancy**: Don't start with "image of" or "picture of"—screen readers already announce it's an image.

## Examples for Shopify Stores

### Product Images

❌ **Bad**: "shirt"  
✅ **Good**: "Blue cotton button-down shirt with white collar"

❌ **Bad**: "product"  
✅ **Good**: "Leather crossbody bag in tan with gold hardware"

### Lifestyle Images

❌ **Bad**: "woman"  
✅ **Good**: "Woman wearing blue denim jacket while walking in city"

### Decorative Images

For purely decorative images (like background patterns), use empty alt text: `alt=""`

## How to Add Alt Text in Shopify

1. Go to your Shopify admin
2. Navigate to Products
3. Click on a product
4. Scroll to the Images section
5. Click on an image
6. Enter descriptive alt text in the "Alt text" field

## SEO Benefits

Search engines use alt text to understand images, which can improve your rankings in Google Images and help your products appear in relevant searches.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using the same alt text for all product images
- Including "image" or "photo" in the alt text
- Writing alt text that's too vague
- Forgetting to update alt text when product details change

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Every product image has unique, descriptive alt text
- [ ] Alt text includes color, material, and key features
- [ ] Decorative images have empty alt text
- [ ] Alt text is updated when products change

Remember: Good alt text helps everyone—from customers with visual impairments to search engines trying to understand your products.
