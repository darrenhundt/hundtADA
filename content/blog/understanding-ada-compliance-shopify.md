## What is ADA Compliance?

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that businesses make their websites accessible to people with disabilities. For Shopify store owners, this means ensuring your online store can be used by everyone, including those who use screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other assistive technologies.

## Why Does It Matter for Your Shopify Store?

**Legal Protection**: Thousands of businesses receive ADA demand letters each year. Non-compliance can result in expensive lawsuits and settlements.

**Broader Customer Base**: Making your store accessible opens your business to 61 million Americans with disabilities—a market with $490 billion in disposable income.

**Better SEO**: Many accessibility improvements (like proper alt text and semantic HTML) also improve your search engine rankings.

## Common ADA Violations in Shopify Stores

1. **Missing Alt Text**: Images without descriptive alt text prevent screen reader users from understanding your products.

2. **Poor Color Contrast**: Text that's hard to read violates WCAG guidelines and makes your store unusable for many customers.

3. **Keyboard Navigation Issues**: Users who can't use a mouse need to navigate your site entirely with a keyboard.

4. **Missing Form Labels**: Contact forms and checkout processes must have proper labels for assistive technologies.

5. **Inaccessible Videos**: Video content needs captions and transcripts.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Standards

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA is the standard most courts use to determine ADA compliance. Key requirements include:

- **Perceivable**: Content must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Operable**: Interface components must be operable
- **Understandable**: Information and UI operation must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough for assistive technologies

## How to Get Started

If you're concerned about ADA compliance for your Shopify store, start with a professional accessibility audit. This will identify all issues and provide a prioritized action plan.

Remember: ADA compliance isn't just about avoiding lawsuits—it's about creating an inclusive shopping experience for all your customers.
